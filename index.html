      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a aspiring Sofware Developer 
        currently studying Computer Science at Carleton Univeristy.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Lagos, Nigeria</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Saying coding is like basically cheating-
        So apart from coding, it would be spending time playing 
        video games with friends and generally 
        just spending time with friends and family</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Being a software Developer and spending my free time on 
        AI intertractions and just focus and better understand the
        interfaces between people and computers </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Ottawa,ON,CA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For me personally, it starts with just tech in general-
         From being young I have always had this attraction to tech and working with 
         computers to interact with the computer not just on the basic level,
        but by using tool like command prompt to try understand commands and what processing were running 
        beneath on the prettiness on the surface. </p>
